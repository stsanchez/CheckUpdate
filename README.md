# CheckUpdate
Once an hour, at minute 31, a file is generated in a specific directory with important information that must be updated. The file name is the date and time it was generated in format (YYYYMMDD.txt). This code is a task that looks for the last generated file and compares it with the current date and if it is not updated, it sends an email alerting us to solve it quickly.
